Our final project is a raycasting engine akin to the one used for Wolfenstein3D.
It also includes a level editor.

The level editor was written in Java (Brandon Troxell) 
and the game/engine was written in C++ (Phil Anderson and Alex Rutan).

In order to compile the game, you must be running on Linux and have the SDL2.0 library installed.
You can get this package using:

apt-get install libsdl2-dev

In order to run a map you have created with the editor, the game.map file must be manually
moved to the FINALMASTER directory that includes the rest of game's files. A sample is 
included already.

Rules:
Shoot rats to gain 50 points
Rats drop ammo
Pick up ammo to get ammo and 10 points

Controls:
W = forward
S = backward
Left Arrow Key = turn left
Right Arrow Key = turn right
Space = shoot
Escape = quit

Thank you and enjoy!
